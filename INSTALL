INSTALL
#######

Prequisites: Currently a running local redis server is needed, see http://redis.io/
e.g. on Debian/Ubuntu, this can be easily installed with: sudo apt-get install redis-server
on Mac/OS X: brew install redis (and you need to start the redis-server program manually in a console)

You also need Python-2.7 with a couple of additional modules that you can easily install with pip:

pip install flask redis nltk wikipedia ws4py pyaudio topia.termextract

You can now start the scripts from the root directory of the project:

- To start the event server:

python python/event_server.py

- To start the module that finds relevant information (use -l to choose your language):

python python/relevant_event_generator.py -l <en,de>

You can now open http://localhost:5000/ in your browser!

- To simulate microphone input (easier to debug):
python python/simulate_mic_input.py -l <en,de>

- For actual microphone input (needs a Kaldi server instance, English only at the moment):
python python/mic_client.py -i <mic_number>

Windows specific prerequistes

If you have Windows, you should first install Cygwin, which will install basic GNU tools. In the installer, be sure to select and install atleast python-2.7,bash and gcc

Then you need to install pip, which can be done in the cygwin terminal:
easy_install-2.7 pip

You'll find your drives in /cygdrive/, from which you can follow the guide above.
