INSTALL

Flask is needed to run the scripts, it has an integrated web server:

pip install flask

You also need a redis server (http://redis.io/) running on your local machine to run the scripts.

To start the event server:
python python/event_server.py

For actual microphone input (needs Kaldi server running somewhere):
python python/mic_client.py

To simulate microphone input (easier to debug):
python python/simulate_mic_input.py
