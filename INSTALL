INSTALL
#######

Prequisites: Currently a running local redis server is needed, see http://redis.io/
e.g. on Debian/Ubuntu, this can be install with: sudo apt-get install redis-server

You also need Python-2.7 with a couple of additional modules that you can easily install with pip:

pip install flask pyredis nltk wikipedia ws4py pyaudio topia.termextract

You can now start the scripts from the root directory of the project:

- To start the event server:

python python/event_server.py

- To start the module that finds relevant information:

python python/relevant_event_generator.py

You can now open http://localhost:5000/ in your browser!

- To simulate microphone input (easier to debug):
python python/simulate_mic_input.py

- For actual microphone input (needs a Kaldi server instance):
python python/mic_client.py
