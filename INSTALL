INSTALL
#######

Prequisites: Currently a running local redis server is needed, see http://redis.io/
and the port audio library is needed if you want to stream microphone input.

e.g. on Debian/Ubuntu, this can be easily installed with: sudo apt-get install redis-server libportaudio-dev
on Mac/OS X: brew install redis portaudio (and you need to start the redis-server program manually in a console
 or follow the instructions to have it automatically started with each boot)

You need Python-2.7 with a couple of additional modules that you can easily install with pip:

pip install --upgrade numpy
pip install --upgrade scipy
pip install --upgrade flask redis wikipedia ws4py==0.3.2 topia.termextract elasticsearch
pip install --upgrade nltk gensim spacy sklearn
pip install --upgrade pyaudio mutagen

Download needed model files:

sudo python -m spacy.en.download

Open a python shell:

python
>>> import nltk
>>> nltk.download()

Now download the punkt and wordnet packages (only needed for lemmatization, which is turned off by default). 
In the GUI version select those in the list, in the command line version of the downloader type: 

d punkt
d wordnet

You can now start the scripts from the root directory of the project:

- To start the event server:

python python/event_server.py

- To start the module that finds relevant information (use -l to choose your language):

python python/relevant_event_generator_es.py

You can now open http://localhost:5000/ in your browser!

- To simulate microphone input (easier to debug):
python python/simulate_mic_input.py

- For actual microphone input (needs a Kaldi server instance, English only at the moment):
python python/mic_client.py -i <mic_number>

Windows specific prerequistes
#############################

If you have Windows, you should first install Cygwin, which will install basic GNU tools. In the installer, be sure to select and install atleast python-2.7,bash and gcc

Then you need to install pip, which can be done in the cygwin terminal:
easy_install-2.7 pip

You'll find your drives in /cygdrive/, from which you can follow the guide above.
