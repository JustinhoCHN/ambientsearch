so criticism and hostility doesn't work and he didn't listen to these arguments when i hear these arguments i still continue to brazil because i have family and friends these are many people and then the first to defend them but the struggles real how do we were us backed someone's religious believes will still holding them accountable. for the harm or damage that those beliefs may cause others to tough question i still don't have a perfect answer my parents and i had been walking on this tight rope for the last decade. there are intelligent people they're lovely people and let me try to help you understand their perspective in mormonism we believe that after you die if you keep all the rules and you follow all the rituals you can be together as a family again. and to my parents me doing something as simple as having a sleeveless top right now showing my shoulders. that makes me unworthy i won't be with my family in the turn of these but even more had a brother die in a tragic accident at fifteen and something as simple as this means we won't be together as a family and to my parents they cannot understand why something as simple as fashion or women's rights. prevent me from seeing my brother again and not the mindset that we're dealing with and criticism does not change that and so my parents and i have been walking the tightrope explaining our sides respecting one another but actually invalidating each other's very basic believes by the way we live our lives and it's been difficult. called the way that we've been able to do that is to get past those defense of shells and really see the soft inside of unbelief and believe and try to respect each other will still holding boundaries clear.
