and so it's sad to say, but today more than 80 percent of the oceans have plastic in them. it's a horrifying fact. and in past decades, we've been taking those big ships out and those big nets, and we collect those plastic bits that we look at under a microscope, and we sort them, and then we put this data onto a map. but that takes forever, it's very expensive, and so it's quite risky to take those big boats out.
so with my students, ages six to 15, we've been dreaming of inventing a better way. so we've transformed our tiny hong kong classroom into a workshop. and so we started building this small workbench, with different heights, so even really short kids can participate. and let me tell you, kids with power tools are awesome and safe.
not really. and so, back to plastic. we collect this plastic and we grind it to the size we find it in the ocean, which is very small because it breaks down. and so this is how we work. i let the imaginations of my students run wild. and my job is to try to collect the best of each kid's idea and try to combine it into something that hopefully would work. and so we have agreed that instead of collecting plastic bits, we are going to collect only the data. so we're going to get an image of the plastic with a robot -- so robots, kids get very excited. and the next thing we do -- we do what we call "rapid prototyping." we are so rapid at prototyping that the lunch is still in the lunchbox when we're hacking it.
