but my students in hong kong are hyperconnected kids. and they watch the news, they watch the internet, and they came across this image. this was a child, probably under 10, cleaning up an oil spill bare-handed, in the sundarbans, which is the world's largest mangrove forest in bangladesh. so they were very shocked, because this is the water they drink, this is the water they bathe in, this is the water they fish in -- this is the place where they live. and also you can see the water is brown, the mud is brown and oil is brown, so when everything is mixed up, it's really hard to see what's in the water. but, there's a technology that's rather simple, that's called spectrometry, that allows you see what's in the water. so we built a rough prototype of a spectrometer, and you can shine light through different substances that produce different spectrums, so that can help you identify what's in the water. so we packed this prototype of a sensor, and we shipped it to bangladesh. so what was cool about this project was that beyond addressing a local problem, or looking at a local problem, my students used their empathy and their sense of being creative to help, remotely, other kids.
