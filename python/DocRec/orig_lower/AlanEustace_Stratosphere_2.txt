so i want to tell you one thing that you might not have seen in that video, but one of the most critical parts of the entire thing was the release and what happens right after you release. and what we tried to do was use something called a drogue parachute, and a drogue parachute was there to stabilize me. and i'll show you one of those right now. if any of you have ever gone tandem skydiving, you probably used one of these. but the problem with one of these things is right when you release, you're in zero gravity. so it's very easy for this to just turn right around you. and before you know it, you can be tangled up or spinning, or you can release this drogue late, in which case what happens is you're going down at 800 miles an hour, and this thing is going to destroy itself and not be very useful. but the guys at united parachute technologies came up with this idea, and it was a roll that looks like that, but watch what happens when i pull it out. it's forming a pipe. this pipe is so solid that you can take this drogue parachute and wrap it around, and there's no way it will ever tangle with you. and that prevented a very serious potential problem.
