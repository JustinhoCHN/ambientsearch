world war ii changed a lot of things, and one of them was this need to protect people from becoming victims of medical research without informed consent. so some much-needed guidelines or rules were set into place, and part of that was this desire to protect women of childbearing age from entering into any medical research studies. there was fear: what if something happened to the fetus during the study? who would be responsible? and so the scientists at this time actually thought this was a blessing in disguise, because let's face it -- men's bodies are pretty homogeneous. they don't have the constantly fluctuating levels of hormones that could disrupt clean data they could get if they had only men. it was easier. it was cheaper. not to mention, at this time, there was a general assumption that men and women were alike in every way, apart from their reproductive organs and sex hormones. so it was decided: medical research was performed on men, and the results were later applied to women.
what did this do to the notion of women's health? women's health became synonymous with reproduction: breasts, ovaries, uterus, pregnancy. it's this term we now refer to as "bikini medicine." and this stayed this way until about the 1980s, when this concept was challenged by the medical community and by the public health policymakers when they realized that by excluding women from all medical research studies we actually did them a disservice, in that apart from reproductive issues, virtually nothing was known about the unique needs of the female patient.
