i never accepted being excluded because i was a woman, except in my religion. throughout all of that time, i was a part of a very patriarchal orthodox mormon religion. i grew up in an enormously traditional family. i have eight siblings, a stay-at-home mother. my father's actually a religious leader in the community. and i grew up in a world believing that my worth and my standing was in keeping these rules that i'd known my whole life. you get married a virgin, you never drink alcohol, you don't smoke, you always do service, you're a good kid. some of the rules we had were strict, but you followed the rules because you loved the people and you loved the religion and you believed.
everything about mormonism determined what you wore, who you dated, who you married. it determined what underwear we wore. i was the kind of religious where everyone i know donated 10 percent of everything they earned to the church, including myself. from paper routes and babysitting, i donated 10 percent. i was the kind of religious where i heard parents tell children when they're leaving on a two-year proselytizing mission that they would rather have them die than return home without honor, having sinned. i was the type and the kind of religious where kids kill themselves every single year because they're terrified of coming out to our community as gay. but i was also the kind of religious where it didn't matter where in the world i lived, i had friendship, instantaneous mutual aid. this was where i felt safe. this is certainty and clarity about life. i had help raising my little daughter. so that's why i accepted without question that only men can lead, and i accepted without question that women can't have the spiritual authority of god on the earth, which we call the priesthood. and i allowed discrepancies between men and women in operating budgets, disciplinary councils, in decision-making capacities, and i gave my religion a free pass because i loved it.
