on september eleventh two thousand and one, there were one hundred members of core al-qaeda. there were just a few thousand terrorists. they posed an existential threat to no one.
but we rearranged our entire national security apparatus in the most sweeping way since the end of the second world war. we launched two wars. we spent trillions of dollars. we suspended our values. we violated international law. we embraced torture. we embraced the idea that if these 19 guys could do this, anybody could do it. and therefore, for the first time in history, we were seeing everybody as a threat. and what was the result of that? surveillance programs that listened in on the emails and phone calls of entire countries -- hundreds of millions of people -- setting aside whether those countries were our allies, setting aside what our interests were. i would argue that 15 years later, since today there are more terrorists, more terrorist attacks, more terrorist casualties -- this by the count of the u.s. state department -- since today the region from which those attacks emanate is more unstable than at any time in its history, since the flood, perhaps, we have not succeeded in our response.
