my purpose today is to reach out across disciplines and invite design thinking into this big conversation. that is, to bring intention and creativity to the experience of dying. we have a monumental opportunity in front of us, before one of the few universal issues as individuals as well as a civil society: to rethink and redesign how it is we die.
so let's begin at the end. for most people, the scariest thing about death isn't being dead, it's dying, suffering. it's a key distinction. to get underneath this, it can be very helpful to tease out suffering which is necessary as it is, from suffering we can change. the former is a natural, essential part of life, part of the deal, and to this we are called to make space, adjust, grow. it can be really good to realize forces larger than ourselves. they bring proportionality, like a cosmic right-sizing. after my limbs were gone, that loss, for example, became fact, fixed -- necessarily part of my life, and i learned that i could no more reject this fact than reject myself. it took me a while, but i learned it eventually. now, another great thing about necessary suffering is that it is the very thing that unites caregiver and care receiver -- human beings. this, we are finally realizing, is where healing happens. yes, compassion -- literally, as we learned yesterday -- suffering together.
