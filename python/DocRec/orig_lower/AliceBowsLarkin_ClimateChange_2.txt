now, let's just pause for a moment and think about this four-degree global average temperature. most of our planet is actually made up of the sea. now, because the sea has a greater thermal inertia than the land, the average temperatures over land are actually going to be higher than they are over the sea. the second thing is that we as human beings don't experience global average temperatures. we experience hot days, cold days, rainy days, especially if you live in manchester like me.
so now put yourself in a city center. imagine somewhere in the world: mumbai, beijing, new york, london. it's the hottest day that you've ever experienced. there's sun beating down, there's concrete and glass all around you. now imagine that same day -- but it's six, eight, maybe 10 to 12 degrees warmer on that day during that heat wave. that's the kind of thing we're going to experience under a four-degree global average temperature scenario.
and the problem with these extremes, and not just the temperature extremes, but also the extremes in terms of storms and other climate impacts, is our infrastructure is just not set up to deal with these sorts of events. so our roads and our rail networks have been designed to last for a long time and withstand only certain amounts of impacts in different parts of the world. and this is going to be extremely challenged. our power stations are expected to be cooled by water to a certain temperature to remain effective and resilient. and our buildings are designed to be comfortable within a particular temperature range. and this is all going to be significantly challenged under a four-degree-type scenario. our infrastructure has not been designed to cope with this.
