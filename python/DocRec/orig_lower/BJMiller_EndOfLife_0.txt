one night, sophomore year of college, just back from thanksgiving holiday, a few of my friends and i were horsing around, and we decided to climb atop a parked commuter train. it was just sitting there, with the wires that run overhead. somehow, that seemed like a great idea at the time. we'd certainly done stupider things. i scurried up the ladder on the back, and when i stood up, the electrical current entered my arm, blew down and out my feet, and that was that. would you believe that watch still works? takes a licking!
my father wears it now in solidarity.
that night began my formal relationship with death -- my death -- and it also began my long run as a patient. it's a good word. it means one who suffers. so i guess we're all patients.
now, the american health care system has more than its fair share of dysfunction -- to match its brilliance, to be sure. i'm a physician now, a hospice and palliative medicine doc, so i've seen care from both sides. and believe me: almost everyone who goes into healthcare really means well -- i mean, truly. but we who work in it are also unwitting agents for a system that too often does not serve.
