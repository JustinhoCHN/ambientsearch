if you want to buy high-quality, low-price cocaine, there really is only one place to go, and that is the dark net anonymous markets.
now, you can't get to these sites with a normal browser -- chrome or firefox -- because they're on this hidden part of the internet, known as tor hidden services, where urls are a string of meaningless numbers and letters that end in .onion, and which you access with a special browser called the tor browser.
now, the tor browser was originally a u.s. naval intelligence project. it then became open source, and it allows anybody to browse the net without giving away their location. and it does this by encrypting your ip address and then routing it via several other computers around the world that use the same software. you can use it on the normal internet, but it's also your key to the dark net. and because of this fiendishly clever encryption system, the 20 or 30 -- we don't know exactly -- thousand sites that operate there are incredibly difficult to shut down. it is a censorship-free world visited by anonymous users.
