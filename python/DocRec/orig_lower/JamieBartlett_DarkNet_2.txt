now, this kind of consumer-centric attitude is the reason why, when i reviewed 120,000 pieces of feedback that had been left on one of these sites over a three-month period, 95 percent of them were five out of five. the customer, you see, is king. but what does that mean? well, on the one hand, that means there are more drugs, more available, more easily, to more people. and by my reckoning, that is not a good thing. but, on the other hand, if you are going to take drugs, you have a reasonably good way of guaranteeing a certain level of purity and quality, which is incredibly important if you're taking drugs. and you can do so from the comfort of your own home, without the risks associated with buying on the streets.
now, as i said, you've got to be creative and innovative to survive in this marketplace. and the 20 or so sites that are currently in operation -- by the way, they don't always work, they're not always perfect; the site that i showed you was shut down 18 months ago, but not before it had turned over a billion dollars' worth of trade. but these markets, because of the difficult conditions in which they are operating, the inhospitable conditions, are always innovating, always thinking of ways of getting smarter, more decentralized, harder to censor, and more customer-friendly.
let's take the payment system. you don't pay with your credit card, of course -- that would lead directly back to you. so you use the crypto-currency bitcoin, which is easily exchanged for real-world currencies and gives quite a high degree of anonymity to its users.
