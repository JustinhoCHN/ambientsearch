but every night we would report to "mission control" -- different masks they're wearing. it could look like they didn't take the work seriously, but they really did because they're going to have to live with radioactivity their whole life. and so what we did with them is that we'd discuss the data we collected that day, and talk about where we should be going next -- strategy, itinerary, etc... and to do this, we built a very rough topographical map of the region around the nuclear power plant. and so we built the elevation map, we sprinkled pigments to represent real-time data for radioactivity, and we sprayed water to simulate the rainfall. and with this we could see that the radioactive dust was washing from the top of the mountain into the river system, and leaking into the ocean. so it was a rough estimate.
but with this in mind, we organized this expedition, which was the closest civilians have been to the nuclear power plant. we are sailing 1.5 kilometers away from the nuclear power plant, and with the help of the local fisherman, we are collecting sediment from the seabed with a custom sediment sampler we've invented and built. we pack the sediment into small bags, we then dispatch them to hundreds of small bags that we send to different universities, and we produce the map of the seabed radioactivity, especially in estuaries where the fish will reproduce, and i will hope that we will have improved the safety of the local fishermen and of your favorite sushi.
