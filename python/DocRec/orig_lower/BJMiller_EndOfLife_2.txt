flash forward: now i work at an amazing place in san francisco called the zen hospice project, where we have a little ritual that helps with this shift in perspective. when one of our residents dies, the mortuary men come, and as we're wheeling the body out through the garden, heading for the gate, we pause. anyone who wants -- fellow residents, family, nurses, volunteers, the hearse drivers too, now -- shares a story or a song or silence, as we sprinkle the body with flower petals. it takes a few minutes; it's a sweet, simple parting image to usher in grief with warmth, rather than repugnance. contrast that with the typical experience in the hospital setting, much like this -- floodlit room lined with tubes and beeping machines and blinking lights that don't stop even when the patient's life has. cleaning crew swoops in, the body's whisked away, and it all feels as though that person had never really existed. well-intended, of course, in the name of sterility, but hospitals tend to assault our senses, and the most we might hope for within those walls is numbness -- anesthetic, literally the opposite of aesthetic. i revere hospitals for what they can do; i am alive because of them. but we ask too much of our hospitals. they are places for acute trauma and treatable illness. they are no place to live and die; that's not what they were designed for.
