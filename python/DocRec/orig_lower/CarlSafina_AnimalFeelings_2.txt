they have been watching us for much longer than we have been watching them. they know us better than we know them. we have the same imperatives: take care of our babies, find food, try to stay alive. whether we're outfitted for hiking in the hills of africa or outfitted for diving under the sea, we are basically the same. we are kin under the skin. the elephant has the same skeleton, the killer whale has the same skeleton, as do we. we see helping where help is needed. we see curiosity in the young. we see the bonds of family connections. we recognize affection. courtship is courtship. and then we ask, "are they conscious?"
when you get general anesthesia, it makes you unconscious, which means you have no sensation of anything. consciousness is simply the thing that feels like something. if you see, if you hear, if you feel, if you're aware of anything, you are conscious, and they are conscious.
some people say well, there are certain things that make humans humans, and one of those things is empathy. empathy is the mind's ability to match moods with your companions. it's a very useful thing. if your companions start to move quickly, you have to feel like you need to hurry up. we're all in a hurry now. the oldest form of empathy is contagious fear. if your companions suddenly startle and fly away, it does not work very well for you to say, "jeez, i wonder why everybody just left."
