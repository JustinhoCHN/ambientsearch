have you ever wondered what animals think and feel? let's start with a question: does my dog really love me, or does she just want a treat? well, it's easy to see that our dog really loves us, easy to see, right, what's going on in that fuzzy little head. what is going on? something's going on.
but why is the question always do they love us? why is it always about us? why are we such narcissists? i found a different question to ask animals. who are you?
there are capacities of the human mind that we tend to think are capacities only of the human mind. but is that true? what are other beings doing with those brains? what are they thinking and feeling? is there a way to know? i think there is a way in. i think there are several ways in. we can look at evolution, we can look at their brains and we can watch what they do.
