we all go to doctors. and we do so with trust and blind faith that the test they are ordering and the medications they're prescribing are based upon evidence -- evidence that's designed to help us. however, the reality is that that hasn't always been the case for everyone. what if i told you that the medical science discovered over the past century has been based on only half the population?
i'm an emergency medicine doctor. i was trained to be prepared in a medical emergency. it's about saving lives. how cool is that? ok, there's a lot of runny noses and stubbed toes, but no matter who walks through the door to the er, we order the same tests, we prescribe the same medication, without ever thinking about the sex or gender of our patients. why would we? we were never taught that there were any differences between men and women.
