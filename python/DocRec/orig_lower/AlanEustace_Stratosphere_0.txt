so i grew up in orlando, florida. i was the son of an aerospace engineer. i lived and breathed the apollo program. we either saw the launches from our backyard or we saw it by driving in the hour over to the cape. i was impressed by, obviously, space and everything about it, but i was most impressed by the engineering that went into it.
behind me you see an amazing view, a picture that was taken from the international space station, and it shows a portion of our planet that's rarely seen and rarely studied and almost never explored. that place is called the stratosphere.
if you start on the planet and you go up and up and up, it gets colder and colder and colder, until you reach the beginning of the stratosphere, and then an amazing thing happens. it gets colder at a much slower rate, and then it starts warming up, and then it gets warmer and warmer until the point where you can almost survive without any protection, about zero degrees, and then you end up getting colder and colder, and that's the top of the stratosphere. it is one of the least accessible places on our planet. most often, when it's visited, it's by astronauts who are blazing up at it at probably several times the speed of sound, and they get a few seconds on the way up, and then they get this blazing ball of fire coming back in, on the way back in.
