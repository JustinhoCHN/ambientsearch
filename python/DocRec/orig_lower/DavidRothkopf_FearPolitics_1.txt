but there are other problems. and the other problems came from the fact that in washington and in many capitals right now, we're in a creativity crisis. in washington, in think tanks, where people are supposed to be thinking of new ideas, you don't get bold new ideas, because if you offer up a bold new idea, not only are you attacked on twitter, but you will not get confirmed in a government job. because we are reactive to the heightened venom of the political debate, you get governments that have an us-versus-them mentality, tiny groups of people making decisions. when you sit in a room with a small group of people making decisions, what do you get? you get groupthink. everybody has the same worldview, and any view from outside of the group is seen as a threat. that's a danger. you also have processes that become reactive to news cycles. and so the parts of the u.s. government that do foresight, that look forward, that do strategy -- the parts in other governments that do this -- can't do it, because they're reacting to the news cycle. and so we're not looking ahead.
on nine eleven, we had a crisis because we were looking the wrong way. today we have a crisis because, because of 9/11, we are still looking in the wrong direction, and we know because we see transformational trends on the horizon that are far more important than what we saw on 9/11; far more important than the threat posed by these terrorists; far more important even than the instability that we've got in some areas of the world that are racked by instability today. in fact, the things that we are seeing in those parts of the world may be symptoms. they may be a reaction to bigger trends. and if we are treating the symptom and ignoring the bigger trend, then we've got far bigger problems to deal with.
