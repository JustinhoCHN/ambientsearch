but this is really a science talk, and it's really an engineering talk, and what was amazing to me about that experience is that taber said, yes, i think we can build a stratospheric suit, and more than that, come down tomorrow and let's talk to the team that formed the core of the group that actually built it. and they did something which i think is important, which is they took the analogy of scuba diving. so in scuba diving, you have a self-contained system. you have everything that you could ever need. you have a scuba tank. you have a wetsuit. you have visibility. and that scuba is exactly this system, and we're going to launch it into the stratosphere.
three years later, this is what we have. we've got an amazing suit that was made by ilc dover. ilc dover was the company that made all of the apollo suits and all of the extravehicular activity suits. they had never sold a suit commercially, only to the government, but they sold one to me, which i am very grateful for. up here we have a parachute. this was all about safety. everyone on the team knew that i have a wife and two small children -- 10 and 15 -- and i wanted to come back safely. so there's a main parachute and a reserve parachute, and if i do nothing, the reserve parachute is going to open because of an automatic opening device. the suit itself can protect me from the cold. this area in the front here has thermal protection. it will actually heat water that will wrap around my body. it has two redundant oxygen tanks. even if i was to get a quarter-inch hole in this suit, which is extremely unlikely, this system would still protect me from the low pressure of space.
