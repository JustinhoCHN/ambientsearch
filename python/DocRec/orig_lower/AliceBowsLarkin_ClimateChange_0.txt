over our lifetimes, we've all contributed to climate change. actions, choices and behaviors will have led to an increase in greenhouse gas emissions. and i think that that's quite a powerful thought. but it does have the potential to make us feel guilty when we think about decisions we might have made around where to travel to, how often and how, about the energy that we choose to use in our homes or in our workplaces, or quite simply the lifestyles that we lead and enjoy. but we can also turn that thought on its head, and think that if we've had such a profound but a negative impact on our climate already, then we have an opportunity to influence the amount of future climate change that we will need to adapt to.
so we have a choice. we can either choose to start to take climate change seriously, and significantly cut and mitigate our greenhouse gas emissions, and then we will have to adapt to less of the climate change impacts in future. alternatively, we can continue to really ignore the climate change problem. but if we do that, we are also choosing to adapt to very much more powerful climate impacts in future. and not only that. as people who live in countries with high per capita emissions, we're making that choice on behalf of others as well. but the choice that we don't have is a no climate change future.
