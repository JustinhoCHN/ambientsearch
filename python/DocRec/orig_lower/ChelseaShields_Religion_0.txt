religion is more than belief. it's power, and it's influence. and that influence affects all of us, every day, regardless of your own belief. despite the enormous influence of religion on the world today, we hold them to a different standard of scrutiny and accountability than any other sector of our society. for example, if there were a multinational organization, government or corporation today that said no female could be on a leadership board, not one woman could have a decision-making authority, not one woman could handle any financial matter, we would have outrage. there would be sanctions. and yet this is a common practice in almost every world religion today.
we accept things in our religious lives that we do not accept in our secular lives, and i know this because i've been doing it for three decades. i was the type of girl that fought every form of gender discrimination growing up. i played pickup basketball games with the boys and inserted myself. i said i was going to be the first female president of the united states. i have been fighting for the equal rights amendment, which has been dead for 40 years. i'm the first woman in both sides of my family to ever work outside the home and ever receive a higher education.
