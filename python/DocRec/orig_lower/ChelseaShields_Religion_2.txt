so criticism and hostility doesn't work, and i didn't listen to these arguments. when i hear these arguments, i still continue to bristle, because i have family and friends. these are my people, and i'm the first to defend them, but the struggle is real. how do we respect someone's religious beliefs while still holding them accountable for the harm or damage that those beliefs may cause others? it's a tough question. i still don't have a perfect answer. my parents and i have been walking on this tightrope for the last decade. they're intelligent people. they're lovely people. and let me try to help you understand their perspective. in mormonism, we believe that after you die, if you keep all the rules and you follow all the rituals, you can be together as a family again. and to my parents, me doing something as simple as having a sleeveless top right now, showing my shoulders, that makes me unworthy. i won't be with my family in the eternities. but even more, i had a brother die in a tragic accident at 15, and something as simple as this means we won't be together as a family. and to my parents, they cannot understand why something as simple as fashion or women's rights would prevent me from seeing my brother again. and that's the mindset that we're dealing with, and criticism does not change that. and so my parents and i have been walking this tightrope, explaining our sides, respecting one another, but actually invalidating each other's very basic beliefs by the way we live our lives, and it's been difficult. the way that we've been able to do that is to get past those defensive shells and really see the soft inside of unbelief and belief and try to respect each other while still holding boundaries clear.
