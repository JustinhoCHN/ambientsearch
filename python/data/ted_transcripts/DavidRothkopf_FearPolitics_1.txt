but there were other problems. and the other problems came from the fact that in washington and in many capitals right now we're in a creativity crisis in washington in think tanks were people are supposed to be thinking of new ideas you don't get bold new ideas because if you offer up a bold new idea not only are you attacked on twitter but you will not get. confirmed of a government job up because we are reactive to the heightened venom of the political debate you get governments that have an us versus them mentality tiny groups of people making decisions when you set in a room with a small group of people making decisions what do you get good group think everybody is the same. moral view and any view from outside of the group are seen as a threat that's a danger you also have processes that become reactive to news cycles and so the parts of the u.s. government that do for site that look forward that to strategy the parts another governments that do this can't do it because they're reacting to the new. michael and so we're not looking ahead on nine eleven we have a crisis because we were looking the wrong way today we have a crisis because because of nine eleven we are still looking in the wrong direction and we know because we see transformational trends on the horizon that are far more. important than what we saw on nine eleven. far more important than the threat posed by these terrorists far more important even then instability that we've got in some areas of the world that are wracked by instability today and fact the things that we are seeing in those parts of the world may be symptoms they may. maybe a reaction to bigger trance and if we are treating the symptom and ignoring the bigger trend than we've got far bigger problems to deal with.
