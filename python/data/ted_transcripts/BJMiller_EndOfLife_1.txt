my purpose today is to reach out. across disciplines and invite design thinking into this big conversation that is. to bring in tension and creativity to the experience of time. we have a monumental opportunity in front of us before a universal one of the few universal issues as individuals as well as a civil society to rethink and redesign how it is we die. so let's begin at the end. for most people the scariest thing about death isn't being dead its dine suffering the key distinction. and to get underneath this it can be very helpful to tease out suffering which is necessary as it is from suffering we can change the former is a natural essential part of life part of the deal and to this we are called to make space but just grow. but it can be really good to realize forces larger than ourselves. the bring proportionality. a cosmic right sizing. after my limbs were gone that loss for example became fact fixed necessarily part of my life and i learned i could no more reject. but this fact that reject myself. to me while but i'd learned eventually. now another great thing about necessary something is that it is the very thing that unites caregiver and care receiver. human beings. this we are finally realizing his were stealing happens yes compassion literally as we learned yesterday suffering together.
