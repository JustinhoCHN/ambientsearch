flash forward now i work a an amazing place in san francisco called his and hospice project where we have a little ritual that helps with this shift in perspective. when one of our residents dies. the mortuary men come as were willing the body out through the garden heading for the gate we pause anyone who wants. other residents family nurses volunteers to her strivers to now share a story or a song or silence as we sprinkle the body with flower petals takes a few minutes sweet simple parting image usher in grief with warmth. rather than repugnance. contrast that with the typical experience in the hospital setting. much like this floodlit room lined with tubes in keeping sheen's and blinking lights of don't stop even when the patient's life has. cleaning crews would say in the bodies was the way it's all so it feels as though that person had never really existed. well intended of course in the name of strongly but hospitals tend to assault our senses and the most we might hope for within those walls is numbness. anaesthetic literally the opposite of static. i revere hospitals for what they can do i am alive because of them. but we have too much of our hospitals. their places for acute trauma and treatable illness there no place to live and die that's not what they were designed for.
