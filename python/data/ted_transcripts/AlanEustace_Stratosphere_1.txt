but this is really a science talk and it's really an engineering talk was amazing to me about that experience is that tabor said yes i think we can build a stress for two more than that come down tomorrow and let's talk to the team that form the core of the group that actually built it and die. they did something which i think is important which is they took the analogy of scuba diving so in scuba diving you have a self-contained system you have everything that you could ever need you have a scuba tank you have a wetsuit you have visibility and. that scuba is exactly the system and we're going to launch into the stratosphere three years later this is what we have got an amazing sued those made by i'll see dover i'll see dover was the company made all the apollo suits and all the extra vehicle activity says they never saw. still a suit commercially only to the government but they so when to be which i'm very grateful for appear we have a parachute this was all about safety i at no one of the team of our everyone on the team knew that i have a wife and two to small children ten and. a fifteen and i want to come back safely so there's a main parachute and reserve parachute and if i do nothing the reserve parachute scalp and because of an automatic opening device the suit itself can protect me from the call this area in the frontier has thermal protection it will actually he water that will wrap around my body. it has to be done and oxygen tanks even if i was to get a quarter inch hole in this suit which is extremely unlikely this system would still protect me from the press from the low pressure space
