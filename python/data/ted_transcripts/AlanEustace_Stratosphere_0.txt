so i grew up for a land of florida i was a sign of an aerospace engineer. i lived and breathed the apollo program we their saw the largest from my backyard or we sought by driving the hour over to the cape i was impressed by obviously space everything about it but i was most impressed by the engineering that went into it. behind the sea amazing viewed a picture was taken from the international space station and it shows a portion of our planet that's rarely seen and rarely studied and almost never explored that place is called the stratosphere. if you start on the planet and you go up and up and up it gets colder and colder and colder until you reach the beginning of the stratosphere and an amazing thing happens it gets colder much slower rate and then started warming up and then it gets warmer warmer until the point where you could almost survive without any. protection about zero degrees and now and you end up getting colder and colder and that's the top of the stratosphere. it is one of the least accessible places our planet most often when it's visited its by astronauts there were blazing opt out at at probably several times the speed of sound and they get a few seconds on the way up and then they get this blazing ball of fire coming back again by the way back. again.
