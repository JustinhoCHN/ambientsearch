now less. this pose for moments and think about this photograph a global average temperature most of our planet's is actually made up of the say now because the say has a greater thermal energy than the land they average temperatures overlander as she couldn't be higher than they are ever the say the second saying is that. we as human beings don't experience global average temperatures we experience hot days cold days rainy days especially if you live in manchester like may do so now put yourself in a city centre imagined somewhere in the world mumbai beijing new york london it's the hottest say that you've ever. experienced there's son basing down this concrete and glass all around showing now imagine a same day that is six eight maybe ten to twelve degrees warmer on monday during a heat wave that's the kind of thing we're going to experience under forty are a global average. purchase an area and the problem with these extremes and not just the temperature extremes but also the extremes in terms of storms and other climate impacts is our infrastructure is just not set up to deal with the source of events so our roads in our rail networks have been designed to last for a long time and withstand only. the amounts of impacts in different parts of the world and this is going to be extremely challenge our power stations are expected to be cooled by water to certain temperature to remain effective and resilient and our buildings are designed to be comfortable with in a particular temperature range and this is all going to be significantly. changed under a four degree types an area where our infrastructure has not been designed to cope with this.
