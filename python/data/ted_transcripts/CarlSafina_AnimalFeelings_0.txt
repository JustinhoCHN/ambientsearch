wondered what animals think and feel let's start with the question is my dog really love me or does he just want to treat well it's easy to see that our dog really loves us easy to see right what's going on in. that fuzzy little head what is going on. something's going on. why is the question always do they love us why is it always about us why are we so much narcissists. i found a different question to ask and its. who are you. there are capacities of the human mind that we tend to think our capacities only of the human mind but is not true. what are other beings doing with those brains what are they thinking and feeling is their way to know i think there is a way an i think there are several ways in we can look at evolution we can look at their brains and we can watch what they do.
