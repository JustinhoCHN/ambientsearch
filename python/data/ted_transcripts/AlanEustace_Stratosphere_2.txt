so i want to tell you one thing that you might not have seen in that video but one of the most critical parts of the entire thing was the release and what happens right after the release and what we try to do is use something called the drug parachute and drug care she was there to stabilise me and i'll show you one of those right now. if any of you have ever gone tandem skydiving you probably use ways. but the problem with one of these things is right when you release here in zero gravity so it's very easy for this to just turn right around you and before you know it you can be tangled up or spending and or you can release a stroke a late in which case what's happening is you're going down at eight hundred. miles an hour and this thing is going to destroy itself and not be very useful. but the guys a united parachute technology came up with this idea and it was a role the looks like that but watch what happens when i pull it out. it's forming a pipe. this guy is so solid. that you can take this drug parachute a wraparound and there's no way of will ever tangle with you. and that prevented a very serious potential problem
