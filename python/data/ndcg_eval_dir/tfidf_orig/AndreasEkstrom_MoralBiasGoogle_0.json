Why is Google the search engine of choice for you? Strangely enough, I always get the same three answers. One, \"Because it works,\" which is a great answer; that's why I Google, too. Two, somebody will say, \"I really don't know of any alternatives.\" It's not an equally great answer and my reply to that is usually, \"Try to Google the word 'search engine,' you may find a couple of interesting alternatives.\" And last but not least, thirdly, inevitably, one student will raise her or his hand and say, \"With Google, I'm certain to always get the best, unbiased search result.\" Certain to always get the best, unbiased search result.\nNow, as a man of the humanities, albeit a digital humanities man, that just makes my skin curl, even if I, too, realize that that trust, that idea of the unbiased search result is a cornerstone in our collective love for and appreciation of Google. I will show you why that, philosophically, is almost an impossibility.\nBut let me first elaborate, just a little bit, on a basic principle behind each search query that we sometimes seem to forget. So whenever you set out to Google something, start by asking yourself this: \"Am I looking for an isolated fact?\" What is the capital of France? What are the building blocks of a water molecule? Great -- Google away. There's not a group of scientists who are this close to proving that it's actually London and H30. You don't see a big conspiracy among those things. We agree, on a global scale, what the answers are to these isolated facts.", "filename": "AndreasEkstrom_MoralBiasGoogle_0.txt"}
