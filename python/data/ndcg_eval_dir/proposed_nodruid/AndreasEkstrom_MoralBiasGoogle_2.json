Let's see if we, in the civilized world, can protest against what he did through insulting him in his search results.\"\nAnd how?

Make sure to write the terrorist's name in the caption, make sure to name the picture file \"Breivik.jpeg.\" Let's teach Google that that's the face of the terrorist.\" And it worked. Two years after that campaign against Michelle Obama, this manipulation campaign against Anders Behring Breivik worked. If you picture-Googled for him weeks after the July 22 events from Sweden, you'd see that picture of dog poop high up in the search results, as a little protest.", "filename": "AndreasEkstrom_MoralBiasGoogle_2.txt"}
