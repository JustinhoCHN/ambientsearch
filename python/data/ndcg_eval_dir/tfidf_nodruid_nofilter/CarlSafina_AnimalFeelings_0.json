Something's going on.\nBut why is the question always do they love us? Why is it always about us? Why are we such narcissists? I found a different question to ask animals. Who are you?\nThere are capacities of the human mind that we tend to think are capacities only of the human mind. But is that true? What are other beings doing with those brains? What are they thinking and feeling? Is there a way to know? I think there is a way in. I think there are several ways in.
