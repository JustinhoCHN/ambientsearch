TODOS
- Extend python python/simulate_mic_input.py to simulate keywords and add more events
- Test out wiki_search.py (this is untested code)
- Display wikipedia data dynamically with js, according to incoming events, extend bridge.py as nessecary
- Additional event for points of interest on a map (Benjamin: I will work on the NLP part of this, simulate as nessecary)
- History? Maybe past keywords are accesisable by scrolling the page
- Pause button to stop speech input
- Figure out best font sizes and if everything resizes correctly and responsively on a big screen, and if everything still looks good on a laptop at the same time
