TODOS
#####

- Star and close
- Pictures
- Reset button for relevant entries (to manually reset the topics)
- Allow the use of subtitled movies as input (B)
- Support German input (B)
- History? Maybe past keywords are accesisable by scrolling the page or one of the bootstrap timeline widgets
- Settings? What could be good to include here, e.g. language (there will be German and English)
(- Pause button to stop speech input)
- Figure out best font sizes and if everything resizes correctly and responsively on a big screen, and if everything still looks good on a laptop at the same time

What can be experimented on to improve relevant document display and online performance:

(1) Right now, relevant articles are determined after a full utterance. This could also be done on the fly.
(2) Starting/warmup phase: some lowly ranking keywords will be used in the beginning, maybe restrict number of relevant entries at first
