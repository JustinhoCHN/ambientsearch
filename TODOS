TODOS
#####

- Starring relevant entries like a bookmark and closing relevant entries (Benjamin: non-functional buttons were already in my local copy, pushed this now)
- Pictures, what source? Wiki or Flicker?
- Bug: Modal can be deleted while it is displayed. Open relevant entries should never be deleted from the display.
- Reset button to remove all relevant entries (to manually reset the topic)
- Allow the use of subtitled movies as input (B)
- Support German input (B)
- History? Maybe past keywords are accesisable by scrolling the page or one of the bootstrap timeline widgets
- Settings? What could be good to include here, e.g. language (there will be German and English)
(- Pause button to stop speech input)
- Figure out best font sizes and if everything resizes correctly and responsively on a big screen, and if everything still looks good on a laptop at the same time

What can be experimented on to improve relevant document display and online performance:

(1) Right now, relevant articles are determined after a full utterance. This could also be done on the fly. (B)
(2) Starting/warmup phase: some lowly ranking keywords will be used in the beginning, maybe restrict number of relevant entries at first. (B)
